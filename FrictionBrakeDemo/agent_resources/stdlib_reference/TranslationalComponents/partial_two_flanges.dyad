"""
Base component representing a one-dimensional mechanical component with two translational connection points (flanges).

This partial component provides a standardized interface consisting of two mechanical translational flanges, `flange_a` and `flange_b`.
It serves as a common base class for developing models of physical devices that interact with their surroundings
at two distinct translational mechanical ports, such as springs, dampers, or masses.
The component itself does not define any physical behavior or equations; its sole purpose is to declare these connection points.
