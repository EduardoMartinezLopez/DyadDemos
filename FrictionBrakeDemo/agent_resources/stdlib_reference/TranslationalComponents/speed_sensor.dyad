"""
Ideal sensor that measures the absolute translational velocity of a mechanical flange.

This sensor provides the absolute velocity of its connected `flange`.
The velocity `v` is determined by taking the time derivative of the `flange`'s
absolute position `s`. The governing equation is:
```math
v = \frac{d flange.s}{dt}
```
