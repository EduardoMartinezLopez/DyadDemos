"""
Measures the absolute linear position of a mechanical translational flange.

This sensor provides the absolute translational position of its connection point.
It inherits from `PartialAbsoluteSensor`, which defines a mechanical
translational `flange`. The sensor's `RealOutput` signal, named `s`, directly
reflects the position variable `s` associated with this `flange`.
The fundamental behavior is captured by the equation:
```math
s = flange.s
```
Here, the `s` on the left side of the equation is the sensor's output signal,
and `flange.s` is the position variable of the connector inherited from
`PartialAbsoluteSensor`.
