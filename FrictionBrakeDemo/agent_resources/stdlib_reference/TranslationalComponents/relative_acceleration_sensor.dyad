"""
Ideal sensor measuring the relative acceleration between two translational flanges.

This sensor determines the acceleration of `flange_b` with respect to `flange_a`
(where `s_a` and `s_b` in the equations below refer to `flange_a.s` and `flange_b.s`
respectively). It operates by first calculating the relative displacement,
$s_{rel} = s_b - s_a$. This relative displacement is then differentiated with
respect to time to obtain the relative velocity, $v_{rel} = \frac{d(s_{rel})}{dt}$.
Finally, the relative velocity is differentiated with respect to time to yield the
relative acceleration, $a_{rel} = \frac{d(v_{rel})}{dt}$. The sensor is ideal,
meaning it does not exert any force on the connected components; specifically, the force at
`flange_a` is defined as zero, ensuring no mechanical load is introduced by the sensor.
