"""
Models a linear translational spring and a linear translational damper connected in parallel.

This component describes the behavior of an ideal translational spring and an ideal translational viscous damper
that are arranged in parallel. The total force `f` generated by the component is the sum of the force from the
spring `f_c` and the force from the damper `f_d`. The relative displacement across the component is `s_rel`
and the relative velocity is `v_rel`.
The spring force is determined by Hooke's Law:
```math
f_c = c \cdot (s_{rel} - s_{rel0})

```
where `c` is the spring constant and `s_rel0` is the value of `s_rel` at which the spring is relaxed (exerts no force).
The damper force is proportional to the relative velocity:
```math
f_d = d \cdot v_{rel}
```
where `d` is the damping constant.
The total force exerted by the component is:
```math
f = f_c + f_d
```
Power dissipated by the damper is calculated as:
```math
lossPower = f_d \cdot v_{rel}
```
The component typically inherits `s_rel`, `v_rel`, and `f` from a base class like `PartialCompliantWithRelativeStates`.
