"""
Represents a sliding mass with inertia, subject to external and gravitational forces.

This component models the translational motion of a point mass along a single axis. It considers the mass's inertia, external forces applied through its two mechanical connection flanges (`flange_a` and `flange_b`), and a gravitational effect determined by parameters `g` and `theta`. The position `s`, velocity `v`, and acceleration `a` are related by `v = der(s)` and `a = der(v)`. The core dynamic behavior is defined by Newton's second law, expressed as:
```math
m \cdot (a + g \cdot \sin(\theta)) = \text{flange_a.f} + \text{flange_b.f}
```math
where `m` is the mass, `a` is its acceleration, `g` is the gravitational acceleration parameter, `\theta` is the angle parameter, and `\text{flange_a.f} + \text{flange_b.f}` represents the sum of external forces applied via the flanges.
