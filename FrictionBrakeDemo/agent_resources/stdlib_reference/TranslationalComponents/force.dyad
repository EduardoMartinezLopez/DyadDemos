"""
An ideal force source that applies equal and opposite forces to two translational mechanical flanges, controlled by an external signal.

This component models an ideal source of force acting between its two translational mechanical flanges, `flange_a` and `flange_b` (inherited from `PartialTwoFlanges`).
The magnitude and direction of the force are determined by the external input signal `f`. The input `f` directly defines the force exerted by `flange_a` on the connected component.
The core behavior is defined by the equations relating the flange forces to the input signal $f$ :
```math
flange\_a.f = f \\
flange\_b.f = -f
```
