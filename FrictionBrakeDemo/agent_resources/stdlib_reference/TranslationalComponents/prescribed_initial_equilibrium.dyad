"""
Sets the initial velocity and acceleration of a connected flange to zero.

This component is used to define an initial equilibrium state for a mechanical
system connected via its `flange`. It ensures that at the beginning of the
simulation, the velocity `v` and acceleration `a` of the connected element
are both zero. This is achieved through the equations:
```math
\begin{align*}
v(0) &= 0\\
a(0) &= 0
\end{align*}
```
Additionally, the component ensures that the force `flange.f` at the connection
point is zero. The velocity and acceleration are locally defined as derivatives
of the flange's position `s`:
```math
v = \frac{d(\text{flange.s})}{dt}
```
```math
a = \frac{dv}{dt}
```
This effectively means that the connected mechanical component starts from a
standstill with no initial forces applied through this specific constraint.
