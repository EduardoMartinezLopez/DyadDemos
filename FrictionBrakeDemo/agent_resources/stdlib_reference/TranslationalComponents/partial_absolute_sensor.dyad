"""
Base model for an ideal mechanical sensor measuring absolute flange variables by ensuring zero force interaction.

This partial component establishes the foundation for sensors that measure absolute physical quantities
(such as position or velocity) of a 1D mechanical translational system through its 'flange' connector.
Its defining characteristic is that it imposes no force on the connected system, a behavior governed by
the equation `flange.f = 0`. This principle ensures that the measurement process
itself does not alter the system's dynamics, embodying an ideal sensor in terms of force interaction.
Concrete sensor components derived from this partial model would further specify which variable
(e.g., position 'flange.s' or velocity 'flange.v') is measured.
