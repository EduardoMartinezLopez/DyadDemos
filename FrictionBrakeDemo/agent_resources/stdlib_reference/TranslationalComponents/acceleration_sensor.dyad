"""
Ideal sensor measuring the absolute translational acceleration of a flange.

This component measures the absolute acceleration of its connected flange.
It first determines the absolute velocity of the flange by taking the time derivative
of the flange's absolute position ($\text{flange.s}$). The absolute acceleration
is then computed as the time derivative of this velocity.
The governing equations are:
```math
\begin{align*}
v &= \frac{d(\text{flange.s})}{dt} \\
a = \frac{dv}{dt} &= \frac{d^2({\text{flange.s}})}{dt^2}
\end{align*}
```
where $v$ is the internal absolute velocity variable and $a$ is the
output signal representing the absolute acceleration. The position $\text{flange.s}$
is accessed via the `flange.s` variable, with the `flange` itself being inherited from `PartialAbsoluteSensor`.
