"""
Base two-port element for relative sensing, ensuring conservation of flow between its connection points.

This `partial component` acts as a base for creating sensors that measure a physical quantity at `flange_b` with respect to `flange_a`.
It includes two `Flange` connectors: `flange_a`, typically serving as the negative or reference connection, and `flange_b`,
serving as the positive or measurement connection. The core behavior is defined by the conservation equation
in the `relations` section, which mandates that the sum of flow variables (`f`) at these flanges is zero:
```math
flange_a.f + flange_b.f = 0
```
This is equivalent to ```math flange_a.f = -flange_b.f ```, signifying that the sensor does not accumulate
or dissipate the quantity represented by `f` (e.g., current, fluid flow). Sensors derived from this
partial model would typically add equations to report a measured potential difference (like voltage or pressure)
between `flange_b` and `flange_a`.
