"""
Models a massless, rigid connection of a defined length between two translational 1D flanges.

This partial component defines an ideal rigid bar of length `L` that connects two
translational 1D mechanical flanges, `flange_a` and `flange_b`. The component's
position is characterized by the absolute coordinate `s` of its center point.
The positions of the flanges are then kinematically constrained relative to this
center point and the length `L`. The key equations governing these positions are:
```math
flange\_a.s = s - \frac{L}{2}
```
```math
flange\_b.s = s + \frac{L}{2}
```
This also implies that the distance between the flanges is fixed:
```math
flange\_b.s - flange\_a.s = L
```
As a `partial component`, it is intended to be used as a base for other, more complete components.
