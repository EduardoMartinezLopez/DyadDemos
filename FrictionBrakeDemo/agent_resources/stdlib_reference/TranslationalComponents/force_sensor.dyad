"""
Ideal sensor measuring the translational force transmitted between two flanges.

This component models an ideal sensor that measures the translational force acting between its two mechanical flanges, `flange_a` and `flange_b`.
It ensures the sensor body is perfectly rigid, meaning no relative displacement between the flanges.
This is expressed by the equation:

```math
flange_a.s = flange_b.s
```

The force exerted at `flange_a` is directly measured and provided as the output signal `f`:

```math
flange_a.f = f
```

By Newton's third law, the force at `flange_b` is equal and opposite to the force at `flange_a`:

```math
flange_b.f = -flange_a.f
```
