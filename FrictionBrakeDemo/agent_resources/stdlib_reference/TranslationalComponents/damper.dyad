"""
Linear translational damper relating force to relative velocity.

This component represents an ideal linear translational mechanical damper.
The force `f` generated by the damper is proportional to the relative velocity `v_{rel}` between its two mechanical flanges.
The constant of proportionality is the translational damping coefficient `d`.
The force always acts to oppose the relative motion between the flanges.
The component also calculates the instantaneous power `lossPower` dissipated by the damping action.
The defining equations are:
```math
f = d \cdot v_{rel}
```
```math
lossPower = f \cdot v_{rel} = d \cdot v_{rel}^2
```
