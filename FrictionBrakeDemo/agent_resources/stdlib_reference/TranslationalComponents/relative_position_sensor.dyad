"""
Measures the ideal relative translational position between two mechanical flanges.

This component calculates the translational position of `flange_b` with respect to `flange_a`.
It provides this relative position as an output signal `s_rel`. The sensor is considered
ideal because it does not exert any forces on the flanges it connects to, meaning it
does not influence the dynamics of the mechanical system. This is enforced by the
equation `flange_a.f = 0`. The primary relationship is:
```math
s_{rel} = flange_b.s - flange_a.s
```
where `s_{rel}` is the relative position, `flange_b.s` is the absolute position of `flange_b`,
and `flange_a.s` is the absolute position of `flange_a`.
