"""
Linear 1D translational spring relating force to displacement via Hooke's Law.

This component represents a one-dimensional translational mechanical spring.
It models the linear relationship between the force ($f$) exerted by the
spring and its deformation ($s_{rel}$) relative to an unstretched length ($s_{rel0}$).
The governing equation is Hooke's Law:
```math
f = c \cdot (s_{rel} - s_{rel0})
```
Here, `c` is the spring constant (stiffness), $s_{rel}$ is the current
relative displacement between the spring's two connection flanges (typically
inherited from `PartialCompliant`), and $s_{rel0}$ is the relative displacement
at which the spring exerts no force.
