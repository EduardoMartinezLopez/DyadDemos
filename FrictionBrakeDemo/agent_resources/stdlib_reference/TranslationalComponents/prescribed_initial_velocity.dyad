"""
Sets an initial velocity condition for a translational mechanical flange.

This component defines the starting velocity of a one-dimensional mechanical
translational interface, represented by its `flange`. It utilizes a parameter `v0`
to specify this desired initial velocity. At the beginning of a simulation,
an internal variable `v` (which also represents the flange's velocity) is set
to `v0`. The component ensures that the derivative of the flange's position,
`der(flange.s)`, is equal to this velocity `v`. Additionally, it exerts no
force through the flange, as indicated by `flange.f = 0`, acting as a pure
kinematic specification for the initial velocity. The key relations are:
```math
\begin{align*}
v(0) &= v0 \\
\frac{d(flange.s)}{dt} &= v\\
flange.f &= 0
\end{align*}
```
