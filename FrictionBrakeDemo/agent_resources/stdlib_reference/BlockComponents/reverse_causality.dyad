"""
Forces equality between two input signals by computing an implicit output.

The way to think about this component is that it computes an output (implicitly)
such that the two inputs are equal.  To do this, it must be possible for the output
to affect at least one of the inputs somehow.  This component supports model
inversion scenarios where one of the outputs is prescribed and the system works
backward to solve for one of the inputs.
