"""
Tests interpolation by applying linear interpolation to a dataset of squares.

This component creates an interpolation object configured with linear interpolation and a dataset
containing time values from 0 to 1 and their corresponding squared values. The current simulation
time is used as the input to the interpolation, and the interpolated output is assigned to the
variable `y`. The metadata includes a test case that runs until time=1 and verifies the `y` signal.
