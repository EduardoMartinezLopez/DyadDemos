"""
Second-order linear system for testing control designs.

A linear dynamic system with second-order behavior that exhibits damped oscillations in response to inputs.

The system is described by the state-space representation:

```math
\begin{align}
\dot{x}_1 &= x_2 \\
\dot{x}_2 &= -x_1 - 0.5x_2 + u \\
y &= 0.5x_1 + x_2
\end{align}
```

where states `x1` and `x2` represent position and velocity in a mechanical system analogy.
