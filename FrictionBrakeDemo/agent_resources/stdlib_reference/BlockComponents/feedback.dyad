"""
Computes the difference between a reference input and a feedback input.

This block calculates the error signal in a feedback control system by subtracting the feedback
input (`u2`) from the reference input (`u1`). The component is typically used at the beginning of a
control system to determine the difference between a desired setpoint and the measured output
being fed back.
