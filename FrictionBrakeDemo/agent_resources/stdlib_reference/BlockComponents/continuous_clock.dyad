"""
Generates a continuous time signal that starts counting from a specified time.

A clock component that outputs a continuously increasing signal starting from a
specified time. The output equals the `offset` value until the simulation time
reaches `start_time`, after which it increases linearly with time. The output
value is calculated as `offset` + (`time` - `start_time`) when `time` exceeds
`start_time`, otherwise it remains at the `offset` value.
