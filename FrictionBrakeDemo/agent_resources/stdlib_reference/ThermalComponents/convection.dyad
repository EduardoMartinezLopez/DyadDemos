"""
Models heat transfer by convection where the thermal conductance is a signal input.

This component represents a lumped thermal element that experiences heat convection.
The rate of heat transfer, `Q`, is determined by the product of the
convective thermal conductance, `Gc`, and the temperature difference, `ΔT`,
across the element. The convective thermal conductance `Gc` is not a fixed
parameter but rather a time-varying signal input to the component.
The governing equation is:
```math
Q = G_c \cdot \Delta T
```
The temperature difference `ΔT` and the heat flow `Q` are typically
defined in or inherited from the base class `ConvectiveElement1D`.
