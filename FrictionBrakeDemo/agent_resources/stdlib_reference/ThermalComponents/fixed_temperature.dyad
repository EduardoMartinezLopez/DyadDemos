"""
Defines a fixed temperature boundary condition at its port.

This component models an ideal thermal source that maintains a constant temperature at its connection port.
The temperature value is specified by the parameter `T`. It acts as a boundary condition in thermal systems,
ensuring that the connected point in the system is held at the prescribed temperature, regardless of the heat flow.
The core behavior is defined by the equation:
```math
\text{node.T} = T
```
where `node.T` is the temperature at the port and `T` is the specified fixed temperature parameter.
