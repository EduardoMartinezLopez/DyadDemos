"""
Represents a pure thermal resistance relating temperature difference to heat flow rate.

This component models a lumped thermal resistance where heat is transported without being stored.
The relationship between the temperature difference ($\Delta T$) across the
component and the heat flow rate ($Q$) through it is defined by its constant
thermal resistance ($R$). The fundamental behavior is captured by Fourier's law of heat conduction
in its lumped form:
```math
\Delta T = R \cdot Q
```
This component is acausal and inherits from `Element1D`, implying it has two
thermal ports through which heat can flow.
