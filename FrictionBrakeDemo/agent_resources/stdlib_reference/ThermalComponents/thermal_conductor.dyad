"""
Lumped thermal element for heat conduction without thermal energy storage.

This component models a purely conductive thermal element. Heat flows through the
conductor from the port with higher temperature to the port with lower temperature.
The rate of heat flow `Q` is linearly proportional to the temperature difference
`ΔT` across the element. The constant of proportionality is the thermal
conductance `G`. The relationship is given by Fourier's law for conduction in
its lumped form:
```math
Q = G \cdot \Delta T
```
