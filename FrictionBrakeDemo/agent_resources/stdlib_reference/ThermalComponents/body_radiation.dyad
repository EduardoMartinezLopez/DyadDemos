"""
BodyRadiation models radiative heat transfer between two surfaces.

This component calculates the heat flow due to thermal radiation
between two surfaces, represented by `node_a` and `node_b`. The heat transfer
is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the net heat flow rate `Q`
is proportional to the difference between the fourth powers of the absolute
temperatures of the two surfaces and the net radiation conductance `Gr`.
The parameter `Gr` encapsulates factors such as surface emissivities, areas,
and the view factor between the surfaces.
The governing equation is:
```math
Q = Gr \cdot \sigma \cdot (node\_a.T^4 - node\_b.T^4)
```
