"""
ConvectiveElement1D is baseclass for 1D convective heat transfer elements, defining temperature drop and heat flow between solid and fluid interfaces without energy storage.

This partial component provides the foundational structure for modeling
one-dimensional convective heat transfer. It establishes two connection
ports, `solid` and `fluid`, to interface with respective thermal domains.
The core behavior involves calculating the temperature difference `\Delta T`
(defined as `solid.T - fluid.T`) and the heat flow rate `Q` that is
transferred from the `solid` port to the `fluid` port.

The defining equations are:
```math
\Delta T = solid.T - fluid.T
```
```math
solid.Q = Q
```
```math
fluid.Q = -Q
```
These ensure that `Q` represents heat flowing from the `solid` (e.g., `solid.T` and `solid.Q`)
to the `fluid` (e.g., `fluid.T` and `fluid.Q`). The component itself does not
model any internal energy storage, focusing purely on the heat exchange interface.
