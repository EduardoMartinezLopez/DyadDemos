"""
Element1D is partial one-dimensional thermal element for models without energy storage.

This partial component provides the basic connectors and variables to create
one-dimensional heat transfer models that do not store energy. It defines two
thermal connection ports, `node_a` and `node_b`. The temperature difference
across the element is $\Delta T$, and the heat flow rate through the
element from `node_a` to `node_b` is $Q$.

The key equations governing its behavior are:

Temperature difference:
```math
\Delta T = node\_a.T - node\_b.T
```

Heat flow assignment at ports (assuming $Q$ flows from `node_a` to `node_b`):
```math
node\_a.Q = Q
```
```math
node\_b.Q = -Q
```

The relationship for `node_b.Q` is derived from the model's energy balance equation
$math node\_a.Q + node\_b.Q = 0$, which signifies that no energy is stored
within the element.
