"""
ConvectiveResistor is 1D thermal convective element with a dynamically supplied thermal resistance.

This component models one-dimensional heat convection where the thermal resistance `Rc`
is not a fixed parameter but is provided as an external signal input. It extends
`ConvectiveElement1D`, which provides the thermal interface (two nodes with
temperatures and heat flow) and defines the variables `ΔT` (temperature difference)
and `Q` (heat flow rate). The central equation governing the component's behavior is:
```math
\Delta T = R_c Q
```
This equation states that the temperature difference across the component is the product
of the input convective resistance `R_c` and the heat flow `Q` through it.
The `Rc` input allows for modeling scenarios where the convective heat transfer
coefficient (and thus resistance) changes over time due to varying flow conditions or other factors.
