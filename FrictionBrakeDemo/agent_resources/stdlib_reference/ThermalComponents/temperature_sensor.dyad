"""
Measures the absolute temperature at a thermal node.

This component represents an ideal sensor that measures the absolute temperature
from a thermal `Node`. The temperature at the `node` is directly provided as
a `RealOutput` signal. The sensor is considered ideal because it imposes no
thermal load on the system it is connected to, which is enforced by the
equation `node.Q = 0`. The output temperature `T` is thus defined as:
```math
T = node.T
```
And the heat flow at the node is:
```math
node.Q = 0
```
