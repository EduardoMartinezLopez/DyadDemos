"""
Defines an initial angular acceleration for a rotational mechanical spline.

This component sets a specific initial angular acceleration via its internal `Spline` subcomponent.
The user provides the desired initial angular acceleration as the parameter `a0`.
At the commencement of the simulation, an internal variable `a` is equated to `a0`.
This acceleration `a` is then imposed as the second time derivative of the `Spline`'s
angular displacement (`phi`), as described by the equation:
```math
\frac{d^2\\phi_{spline}}{dt^2} = a
```
Simultaneously, the torque (`tau`) associated with the `spline` is maintained at zero,
ensuring that this component only dictates kinematic motion (specifically initial acceleration)
without applying any torque.
