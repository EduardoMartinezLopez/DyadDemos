"""
Defines a forced angular position for a spline relative to its support based on an input signal.

This component models the controlled angular positioning of a spline with respect
to its supporting structure. It takes an external signal, `phi_ref`, as the
desired or reference angle. The component calculates the actual relative angle, `phi`,
between the spline and its support using the equation:

```math
\\phi = \text{spline}.\\phi - \\phi_\text{support}
```

The core function of this component is to ensure that this actual relative angle
precisely follows the reference input, as defined by the constraint equation:

```math
\\phi = \\phi_\text{ref}
```

The connectors `spline` and `phi_support` are inherited from
`PartialElementaryOneSplineAndSupport`.
