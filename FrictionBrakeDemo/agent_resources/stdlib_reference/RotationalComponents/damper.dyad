"""
Models a linear rotational mechanical damping element where torque is proportional to relative angular velocity.

This component describes a viscous damper for 1D rotational systems. It generates a torque that opposes
the relative motion between its two mechanical rotational ports (flanges). The relationship between the
torque \$\tau\$ and the relative angular velocity \$w_{rel}\$ across the damper is linear and
governed by the damping constant `d`. The defining equation is:
```math
\tau = d \\cdot w_{rel}
```
where `d` is the damping constant (parameter) and \$w_{rel}\$ is the relative angular velocity
between the component's flanges.
