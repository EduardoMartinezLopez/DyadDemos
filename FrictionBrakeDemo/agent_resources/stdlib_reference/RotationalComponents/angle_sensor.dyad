"""
Measures the absolute rotational angle of a connected spline.
This component models an ideal sensor that outputs the absolute angle of a spline.
It directly reflects the `phi` variable of an associated `spline` object, which is
assumed to be defined in the extended `PartialAbsoluteSensor` or through a
connection. The relationship defining the sensor's output is:
```math
phi_{sensor} = spline.phi
```
There are no dynamics, delays, or inaccuracies modeled in this sensor;
it provides a perfect, instantaneous reading of the spline's angle.
