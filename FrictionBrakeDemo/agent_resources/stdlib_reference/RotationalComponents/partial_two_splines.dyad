"""
Base component providing two independent spline instances.

This partial component serves as a base class that encapsulates two distinct instances of a `Spline` component,
declared as `spline_a` and `spline_b`. It is intended to be extended by more complex components that
require dual spline functionalities. `PartialTwoSplines` itself does not define any specific dynamic behavior,
equations, or direct connections; its primary role is to provide these two spline subcomponents and their
associated graphical placement information for a modeling environment.
