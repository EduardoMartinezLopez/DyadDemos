"""
Sets initial zero angular velocity and zero angular acceleration for a rotational connector.

This component establishes an initial equilibrium state for an associated `Spline` connector
by setting its initial angular velocity (`w`) and initial angular acceleration (`a`) to zero.
It also ensures that the torque (`spline.tau`) on the connector is zero.
The component defines the kinematic relationships where angular velocity (`w`) is the
time derivative of the spline's angle (`spline.phi`), and angular acceleration (`a`) is the
time derivative of angular velocity, as expressed in the `relations` section:
```math
\begin{align*}
w &= \frac{d \text{spline.phi}}{dt}\\
a &= \frac{dw}{dt}
\end{align*}
```
These initial conditions and definitions ensure the connected rotational system
starts from a standstill without any initial torque being applied through this prescription.
