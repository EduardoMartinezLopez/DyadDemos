"""
A foundational model for a mechanical component with two rotational shaft interfaces and a supporting housing, establishing torque balance.

This partial component provides a common base for models involving two rotational
mechanical splines (flanges), `spline_a` and `spline_b`, and a central support
spline, `support`, typically representing a casing or ground. The absolute
rotational angle of the `support` spline (`support.phi`) is equated to the model
variable `phi_support`. The fundamental behavior defined is the torque balance on
the support structure. The torque experienced by the support (`support.tau`) is
equal and opposite to the sum of the torques from `spline_a` (`spline_a.tau`) and
`spline_b` (`spline_b.tau`).
These relationships are mathematically expressed as:
```math
\text{support}.\phi = \phi_{\text{support}}
```
```math
\text{support}.\tau = -(\text{spline\_a}.\tau + \text{spline\_b}.\tau)
```
This component is 'partial', meaning it is intended to be extended by other components that will further
define the relationships between the spline angles and torques or connect them to other elements.
