"""
Ideal sensor to measure the relative angle between two splines.

This component computes the difference between the angle of `spline_b` (denoted \$\\phi_b\$)
and the angle of `spline_a` (denoted \$\\phi_a\$). This difference is provided as the output
signal `phi_rel`. It models an ideal sensor, ensuring it does not influence the
dynamics of the connected mechanical system. This is achieved by enforcing that the
torque exerted on `spline_a` (denoted \$\tau_a\$) is zero.
The governing equations are:
```math
\\phi_{rel} = \\phi_b - \\phi_a
```
```math
\tau_a = 0
```
