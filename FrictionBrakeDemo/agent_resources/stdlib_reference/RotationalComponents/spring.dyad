Ideal linear rotational spring.

This component models an ideal linear rotational spring.
The torque `tau` generated by the spring is proportional to the
difference between the relative angle of rotation `phi_rel`
across its flanges and its unstretched angle `phi_rel0`.
The constant of proportionality is the spring constant `c`.
The relationship is defined by Hooke's law for rotational systems:
```math
\tau = c (\\phi_{rel} - \\phi_{rel0})
```
