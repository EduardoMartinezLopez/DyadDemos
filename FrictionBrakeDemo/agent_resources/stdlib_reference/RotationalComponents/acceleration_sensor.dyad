"""
Measures the absolute angular acceleration of a rotational spline.

This sensor determines the absolute angular acceleration of its `spline` connector, leveraging properties inherited from `PartialAbsoluteSensor`, such as the spline's angle (`spline.phi`).
The absolute angular velocity (`w`) is first calculated as the time derivative of this angle:
```math
w = \frac{d\text{spline}.\\phi}{dt}
```
Then, the absolute angular acceleration (`a`) is computed as the time derivative of the angular velocity:
```math
a = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{d^2\text{spline}.\\phi}{dt^2}
```
This resulting acceleration is provided as the output `a`.
