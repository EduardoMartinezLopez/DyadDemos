"""
Measures the ideal absolute angular velocity of a rotational mechanical flange.

This sensor provides an ideal measurement of the absolute angular velocity of a
connected rotational flange. It computes the angular velocity by taking the time
derivative of the absolute angular position, \$\text{spline}.\\phi\$, of the
flange. The angular position \$\text{spline}.\\phi\$ is accessed via a
`spline` connector. The defining equation for the output angular
velocity \$w\$ is:
```math
w = \frac{d(\\phi_{spline})}{dt}
```
