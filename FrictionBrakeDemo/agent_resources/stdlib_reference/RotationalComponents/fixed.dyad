"""
Represents a mechanical rotational element fixed at a specified angle.

This component models a shaft that is rigidly clamped or fixed in its housing,
preventing any rotation. The angle of this fixed shaft, `phi0`, is a
configurable parameter. It effectively acts as an angular boundary
condition in a 1D rotational mechanical system. The core behavior is
defined by the equation that sets the angle of its connection spline
(`spline.phi`) to this fixed parameter `phi0`:
```math
spline.phi = phi0
```
