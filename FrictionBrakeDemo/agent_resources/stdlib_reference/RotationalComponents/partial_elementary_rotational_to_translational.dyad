"""
Base model defining the mechanical interfaces for transforming rotational motion into translational motion.

This partial component establishes the fundamental mechanical ports for components
that convert rotational motion to translational motion. It provides a rotational
input/output (`spline`), a translational input/output (`flange`), and corresponding
support connectors (`support_r`, `support_t`). As a partial model, it does not
contain any equations defining the motion transformation itself but serves as a
structural base to be extended by more specific components. The `Spline` connectors
represent rotational mechanical interfaces, typically characterized by angle
($\phi$) and torque ($\tau$), while `Flange` connectors
represent translational mechanical interfaces, typically characterized by position
($s$) and force ($f$).
