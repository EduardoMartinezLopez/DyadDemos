"""
Defines relative angular states for compliant rotational connections.

This partial component extends a base compliant model by explicitly defining the relative angular velocity ($w_{rel}$) and relative angular acceleration ($a_{rel}$) between two connected rotational elements. These variables are intended to be used as preferred state variables. The core dynamics are described by the differential equations:
```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\phi_{rel}}{dt} = w_{rel}\\
\frac{dw_{rel}}{dt} = a_{rel}
\end{align*}
```
where $\phi_{rel}$ (relative angle) is assumed to be defined in the extended or extending components. This formulation is common in mechanical systems where relative motion is of primary interest.
