"""
Ideal rolling wheel converting rotational motion to translational motion and vice-versa, without inertia.

This component models the ideal kinematic and static interaction between a rotational mechanical port (spline) and a translational
mechanical port (flange) representing a wheel rolling on a surface. It assumes perfect rolling contact, meaning there is no slip.
The wheel itself is considered massless and frictionless, so no inertial effects or energy losses are included.
The key kinematic relationship links the relative angular displacement of the spline (`spline.phi - support_r.phi`)
to the relative translational displacement of the flange (`flange.s - support_t.s`) via the wheel radius:
```math
(\text{spline.phi} - \text{support\\_r.phi}) \\cdot \text{radius} = \text{flange.s} - \text{support\\_t.s}
```math
The static force-torque balance is also defined, relating the torque at the spline (\$\text{spline}.\\tau\$) and the force
at the flange (\$\text{flange.f}\$) through the radius:
```math
\text{radius} \\cdot \text{flange.f} + \text{spline.tau} = 0
```math
