"""
A base model for a mechanical component with a primary rotational spline and an interconnected support spline.

This partial component models the fundamental interaction between a primary rotational shaft spline
and a support spline. The support spline's angle is explicitly defined by the variable `phi_support`.
The key dynamic relationship is that the torque experienced by the support spline is equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction to the torque on the primary shaft spline, representing a common
mechanical reaction. This model is intended as a foundational element for more complex textual models.
The defining equations are:
```math
\text{support}.\phi = \phi_{support}
```
```math
\text{support}.\tau = -\text{spline}.\tau
```
