"""
Models an ideal rack and pinion system, converting rotational motion to translational motion.

This component represents a one-dimensional, inertia-less rack and pinion mechanism.
It establishes a kinematic relationship between the rotation of the pinion
(circular gear) and the translation of the rack (linear gear). The core behavior
is inherited from the `IdealRollingWheel` component. This model assumes no slip
between the rack and pinion and neglects any inertial effects.
