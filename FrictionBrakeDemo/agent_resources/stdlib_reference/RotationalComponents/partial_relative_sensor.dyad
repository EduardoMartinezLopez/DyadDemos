"""
A foundational partial model for measuring relative kinematic variables between two ideal mechanical splines.

This partial component provides the essential structure for sensors that measure
a relative rotational quantity between two splines, denoted as `spline_a` and
`spline_b`. It models an ideal sensing interaction by ensuring that the torques at
the two connection points are equal and opposite, resulting in no net torque being
applied to the system under measurement. This behavior is captured by the equation:
```math
\text{spline\_a}.\tau + \text{spline\_b}.\tau = 0
```math
Specific sensors derived from this partial model would implement the equations for
the particular relative variable (e.g., relative angle, relative speed) being measured.
