"""
Ideal source applying an externally specified torque to a rotational spline.

This component models an ideal torque source for rotational mechanical systems.
It takes an external signal, `tau`, which defines the accelerating torque
to be applied to the connected mechanical `spline`. The component inherits
its mechanical connection interface, `spline`, from `PartialTorque`.
The core behavior is established by the following equation that relates the
input signal `tau` to the torque at the `spline` connector:
```math
spline.\tau = -\tau
```
