"""
A 1D-rotational component with inertia, subject to torques from two splines.

This component represents a rigid body with a moment of inertia `J` that can rotate in one dimension.
It connects to other components via two rotational splines, `spline_a` and `spline_b` (inherited from `PartialTwoSplines`).
The absolute rotation angle of the inertia is `phi`, its angular velocity is `w`,
and its angular acceleration is `a`.
The core dynamic behavior is defined by Newton's second law for rotation:
```math
J \\cdot a = \text{spline\\_a}.\\tau + \text{spline\\_b}.\\tau
```
The kinematic relationships defining angular velocity and acceleration are:
```math
w = \frac{d\\phi}{dt}
```
```math
a = \frac{dw}{dt}
```
Both splines are rigidly attached to the inertia, meaning `phi = spline_a.phi` and `phi = spline_b.phi`.
