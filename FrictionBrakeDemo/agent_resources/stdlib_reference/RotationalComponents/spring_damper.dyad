"""
Models a linear 1D rotational spring and damper acting in parallel.

This component represents a parallel combination of a linear rotational spring and a linear rotational damper. It calculates the total torque based on the relative angular displacement and velocity between its mechanical connection flanges.
The spring torque (\$\tau_c\$) is proportional to the angular displacement from an unstretched reference angle (\$\\phi_{rel0}\$), defined by the spring constant (\$c\$).
The damper torque (\$\tau_d\$) is proportional to the relative angular velocity (\$w_{rel}\$), defined by the damping constant (\$d\$).
The governing equations are:
```math
\begin{align*}
\tau_c &= c (\\phi_{rel} - \\phi_{rel0}) \\
\tau_d &= d w_{rel} \\
\tau &= \tau_c + \tau_d
\end{align*}
```
