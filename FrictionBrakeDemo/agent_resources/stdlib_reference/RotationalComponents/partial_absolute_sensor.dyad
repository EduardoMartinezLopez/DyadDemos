"""
Base ideal sensor for measuring absolute spline variables with no torque interaction.

This `partial` model establishes the foundation for an ideal sensor designed to measure absolute kinematic variables from a `Spline` subcomponent.
A key characteristic of this sensor model is that it does not exert any mechanical load (torque) on the spline it is connected to.
This ideal behavior is enforced by the acausal equation in the `relations` section, which sets the spline's torque to zero:
```math
\text{spline}.\tau = 0
```
As a `partial` component, `PartialAbsoluteSensor` is meant to be extended by concrete sensor implementations that would specify precisely which absolute variable (e.g., absolute angle, displacement) is being measured and outputted.
