"""
Ideal voltage source whose output voltage is determined by a real input signal and a scaling parameter.

This component models an ideal voltage source. The voltage `v` across its positive and
negative pins (inherited from the `TwoPin` base component) is determined by an
external real input signal connected to its `V` input port, and a unit
parameter `uV`. The signal at input `V` is treated as a dimensionless value,
which is then multiplied by the parameter `uV` (which has units of Voltage)
to produce the actual output voltage `v` across the pins.
The relationship is given by:
```math
v = V uV
```
Where `V` is the value of the signal at the `RealInput` port.
