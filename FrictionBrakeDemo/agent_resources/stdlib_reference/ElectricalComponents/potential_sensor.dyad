"""
Measures the electrical potential at a connection point.

This component represents an ideal sensor that measures the electrical potential (voltage)
at a single electrical pin `p`. It is characterized by an infinite input impedance,
meaning it draws no current (`p.i = 0`) from the circuit it is connected to.
The measured potential at pin `p` (`p.v`) is then made available as an output
signal `phi`. This ensures that the sensor does not affect the circuit's behavior
while providing an accurate potential reading. The defining equations are
```math
p.i = 0 \\
\phi = p.v
```
