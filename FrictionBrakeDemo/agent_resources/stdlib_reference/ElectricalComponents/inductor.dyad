"""
Ideal inductor characterized by its inductance L.

This component models a linear inductor, a fundamental passive two-terminal electrical component.
It defines the relationship between voltage `v` and current `i` based on its inductance `L`.
The behavior is described by the equation:
```math
v = L \frac{di}{dt}
```math
where `v` is the voltage across the inductor (difference between pin `p` and pin `n`), `i` is the current flowing through the inductor (from pin `p` to pin `n`), and `L` is its inductance.
