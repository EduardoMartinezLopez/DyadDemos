"""
Measures the electrical potential difference between its two connection terminals.

This component models an ideal voltmeter. It is characterized by an infinite input
impedance, meaning it draws no current from the circuit it is measuring. The voltage
`v` across the sensor is determined by the difference in electrical potential between
its positive pin `p` and its negative pin `n`.
This relationship is defined by the equation:
```math
v = p.v - n.v
```
The currents flowing into both pins are constrained to be zero to ensure ideal behavior:
```math
p.i = 0
```
```math
n.i = 0
```
The pins `p` and `n` are of type `Pin`, representing electrical connection points, and `v`
is a `RealOutput` providing the measured voltage value.
