Ideal electrical capacitor.

This component models a linear capacitor, a fundamental passive two-terminal electrical component
used to store energy electrostatically in an electric field. The relationship between the
current `i` flowing through the capacitor and the voltage `v` across its terminals is
defined by the equation:
```math
C der(v) = i
```
where `C` is the capacitance value and `der(v)` is the time derivative of the voltage `v`.
