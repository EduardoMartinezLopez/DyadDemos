"""
Ideal linear electrical conductor relating current and voltage through its conductance.

This component models an ideal electrical conductor where the electrical current flowing through it
is directly proportional to the voltage difference across its terminals.
The relationship is defined by Ohm's law:
```math
i = G v
```
where `i` is the current, `v` is the voltage, and `G` is the conductance.
The conductance `G` is a parameter, representing the ease with which current
flows through the material, and is the reciprocal of resistance. This model
assumes linear behavior, meaning the conductance `G` remains constant
regardless of the voltage or current. It inherits from `TwoPin`,
implying it has two electrical connection points (pins) where voltage `v` is measured
across and current `i` flows through.
