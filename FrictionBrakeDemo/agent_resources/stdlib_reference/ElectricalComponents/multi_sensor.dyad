"""
Provides combined voltage and current measurements from an electrical circuit.

This component extends a `PowerSensor` to offer voltage, current and power
readings as real-valued outputs. The output `v` represents the measured
voltage, the output `i` represents the measured current and the output `power`
represents power. `v` and `i` outputs are directly sourced from internal
`voltage_sensor` and `current_sensor` subcomponents, which are part of the
inherited `PowerSensor`. The defining equations from the `relations` block are:

```math
v = \text{voltage_sensor.v}
```

```math
i = \text{current_sensor.i}
```

```math
power = \text{voltage_sensor.v*current_sensor.i}
