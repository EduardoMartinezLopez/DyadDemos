"""
Linear electrical resistor following Ohm's Law.

This component represents an ideal linear resistor. The relationship between the
voltage (`v`) across its terminals and the current (`i`) flowing through it is
defined by Ohm's Law:
```math
v = i \R
```
The resistance `R` is a configurable parameter. This component is intended to be
used in electrical circuits where a constant resistance behavior is required.
