"""
A base model for two-terminal electrical components, defining voltage relationship.

This partial component serves as a foundational building block for creating various two-pin electrical devices.
It establishes a common interface with a positive pin (`p`) and a negative pin (`n`).
The voltage across the component (`v`) is defined as the potential difference between these pins:
```math
v = p.v - n.v
```
