"""
A base model for two-terminal electrical components, defining voltage and current relationships.

This partial component serves as a foundational building block for creating various two-pin electrical devices.
It establishes a common interface with a positive pin (`p`) and a negative pin (`n`).
By extending `TwoPin`, it defines voltage across the component (`v`) as the potential difference between these pins:
```math
v = p.v - n.v
```
The current (`i`) flowing through the component is taken as the current entering the positive pin (`p`):
```math
i = p.i
```
Conservation of charge is maintained by enforcing Kirchhoff's Current Law,
ensuring that the current entering one pin exits through the other:
```math
p.i + n.i = 0
```
This model is intended to be extended by specific components like resistors, capacitors, etc.,
which will add their own constitutive equations relating `v` and `i`.
