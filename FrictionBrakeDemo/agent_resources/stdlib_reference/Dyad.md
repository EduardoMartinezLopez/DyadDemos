# Dyad

This is the documentation for the base `Dyad` library.  Here you will find the documentation for the various definitions contained in the base library.

## Connectors:

- BooleanInput: This connector represents a boolean signal as an input to a component
- BooleanOutput: This connector represents a boolean signal as an output from a component
- Flange: This connector represents a mechanical flange with position and force as the potential and flow variables, respectively.
- IntegerInput: This connector represents an integer signal as an input to a component
- IntegerOutput: This connector represents an integer signal as an output from a component
- Node: This connector represents a thermal node with temperature and heat flow as the potential and flow variables, respectively.
- Pin: This connector represents an electrical pin with voltage and current as the potential and flow variables, respectively.
- RealInput: This connector represents a real signal as an input to a component
- RealOutput: This connector represents a real signal as an output from a component
- Spline: This connector represents a rotational spline with angle and torque as the potential and flow variables, respectively.
