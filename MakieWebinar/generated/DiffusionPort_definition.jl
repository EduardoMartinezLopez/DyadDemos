2D Reaction-Diffusion Model on a Grid

Each cell represents a spatial region with a concentration value.
Cells connect to their neighbors and exchange mass through diffusion,
while also undergoing local reaction dynamics.

Physics:
- Diffusion: J = -D * ∇C  (flux proportional to gradient)
- Reaction-Diffusion: dC/dt = D * ∇²C + R(C)  (diffusion + local reaction)

Supported dynamics:
- Pure diffusion (R = 0)
- Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion (pattern formation)
- FitzHugh-Nagumo (excitable media, waves)
- Exponential growth/decay with diffusion
